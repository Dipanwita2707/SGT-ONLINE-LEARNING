# mkcert Root CA Installation Guide for Second Device

## Method 1: Install using mkcert (if mkcert is available on second device)

1. **Download and install mkcert** on your second device:
   - Download from: https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases
   - Or use chocolatey: `choco install mkcert`

2. **Copy the root CA file** `mkcert-rootCA.pem` to your second device

3. **Install the root CA**:
   ```bash
   mkcert -install
   ```

## Method 2: Manual Installation (Windows)

1. **Copy** the file `mkcert-rootCA.pem` to your second device

2. **Install the certificate manually**:
   - Right-click on `mkcert-rootCA.pem`
   - Select "Install Certificate"
   - Choose "Current User" or "Local Machine"
   - Select "Place all certificates in the following store"
   - Click "Browse" and select "Trusted Root Certification Authorities"
   - Click "OK" and "Finish"

## Method 3: Using PowerShell (Windows)

1. **Copy** the file `mkcert-rootCA.pem` to your second device

2. **Run PowerShell as Administrator** and execute:
   ```powershell
   Import-Certificate -FilePath "path\to\mkcert-rootCA.pem" -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\Root
   ```

## Method 4: Browser-specific Installation

### Chrome/Edge:
1. Go to `chrome://settings/certificates` (or `edge://settings/certificates`)
2. Click "Manage certificates"
3. Go to "Trusted Root Certification Authorities" tab
4. Click "Import"
5. Select the `mkcert-rootCA.pem` file

### Firefox:
1. Go to `about:preferences#privacy`
2. Scroll to "Security" section
3. Click "View Certificates"
4. Go to "Authorities" tab
5. Click "Import"
6. Select the `mkcert-rootCA.pem` file

## Verification

After installation, visit `https://10.20.58.236:3000` on your second device. The site should now show as secure (with a lock icon) instead of "Not Secure".

## Troubleshooting

If you still see "Not Secure":
1. **Clear browser cache** and restart the browser
2. **Check if certificate is installed** in the correct store
3. **Try incognito/private mode** to test
4. **Restart the browser** completely

## Security Note

This root CA certificate allows your second device to trust certificates generated by mkcert on this development machine. Only install this on devices you trust for development purposes.
