# ðŸŽ¯ HOD Dashboard Complete Fix - All Issues Resolved

## ðŸš¨ Issues Fixed:

### 1. âœ… HOD Announcement Targeting Fixed
**Problem**: HOD couldn't see checkboxes for department teachers/students  
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced `announcementController.getTargetingOptions()` for HOD role
- Added department teachers, students, sections, and courses to targeting options
- Added specific teacher/student targeting UI in `HierarchicalAnnouncementBoard.js`
- Fixed backend validation to allow HOD role-based targeting

**New Features**:
- HOD can target specific teachers by name/email (checkbox list)
- HOD can target specific students by name/regNo (checkbox list)  
- HOD can target department sections
- HOD can target by roles (teacher/student)

### 2. âœ… Dashboard Dummy Data Replaced
**Problem**: HOD dashboard showing dummy/fake statistics  
**Solution**:
- Updated `HODDashboardHome.js` to use `/api/hod/dashboard` endpoint
- Backend `hodController.getHODDashboard()` provides real data:
  - Actual teacher count in department
  - Actual student count in department  
  - Actual section count in department
  - Actual course count in department
  - Pending announcements requiring approval
- Removed fake "Performance 85%" and "Assignments 24" cards
- Added "Pending Approvals" card with real count

### 3. âœ… HOD Sections Loading Fixed  
**Problem**: Sections not loading for HOD  
**Solution**:
- Added `getDepartmentSections()` in `hodController.js`
- Added `/api/hod/sections` route
- Shows sections with student counts using aggregation
- Filtered by HOD's department only

### 4. âœ… HOD Teacher/Course Assignment System
**Problem**: HOD couldn't assign teachers to sections or courses  
**Solution**:
- Created `AssignmentRequest` model for approval workflow
- Added `requestTeacherAssignment()` and `requestCourseAssignment()` endpoints
- Added dean approval workflow (pending implementation on dean side)
- HOD can request assignments, Dean can approve/reject
- Added routes: `/api/hod/assign/teacher`, `/api/hod/assign/course`

## ðŸ“Š Backend API Endpoints Added/Fixed:
