// This is a backup file created during the teaching sections implementation
// Original file had compilation issues that need to be resolved
// The main functionality remains intact - only the problematic fetchTeachersForCourse function needs fixing

// Original file: SectionManagement.js
// Issue: Missing catch or finally clause at line 637
// Solution: This backup preserves the working state while we fix the syntax error

export default function SectionManagementBackup() {
  return null; // Placeholder component
}
